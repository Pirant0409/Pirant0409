Hi there! üëã

I'm Antoine, a passionate software developer with a keen interest in web and application development. I hold a **Bachelor's** and **Master's degree in Computer Science** from the **University of Namur**, where I honed my skills in programming, problem-solving, and collaborating on innovative projects.  

During my time at university, I was an active member of the [**e-kot project**](https://github.com/e-kot-unamur), contributing to tech-based solutions for a more sustainable and connected community.
